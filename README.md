Single panel display application for various pieces of information relevant to my day. Includes weather and transit needs, as well as time.

TODO:
- Transit display can currently fetch real-time information from the MTA, but does not yet calculate whether this means a train is late or not
- Weather display should only be for the day -- give a high and a low and a general description
- Bus times for local bus stop
